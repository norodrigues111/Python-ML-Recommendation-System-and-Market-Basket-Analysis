    "According to (Wikipedia Contributors, 2019), online retail, also well known as eCommerce, allows customers to buy goods or services using web-based technology. Electronic Commerce permit businesses all over the world, the opportunity to collect customers' data. Technology makes possible to build customers’ profiles based on demographic data, purchase history, preferences, and active data such as likes, views, clicks, and time spent. \n",
    "\n",
    "AI has helped businesses to build powerful analytics tools to improve customer satisfaction and drive revenue.  Recommendation Systems enable businesses to learn about their customers, and so provide more meaningful content, increasing customer satisfaction, and drive business revenue. \n",
    "\n",
    "Industry leaders in online retail are using recommendation systems. Amazon’s recommendations are responsible for 35% of revenue, Netflix’s recommendations are responsible for 75% of the movies seen on the platform, and 60% of the videos watched on YouTube were recommended to their customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendation engines enable customers to find goods or services using different algorithms. They are: Contant-based filtering, based on item features and user profile data; Collaborative-based filtering, based on the similarity with other users (user-to-user or item-to-item); and Hybrid systems that combine Contant-based filtering, and Collaborative-based filtering.\n"
