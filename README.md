# Recommendation-System-and-Market-Basket-Analysis
 CCT College Dublin Continuous Assessment | Assignment Title: Integrated CA Data Visualization Techniques and Machine Learning

Assessment details
Questions:
1) Discuss and explain the purpose of a recommendation system for online retail business in machine
learning. Briefly compare Content and Collaborative filtering using any dataset of your choice (Datasets used
in the class tutorials or exercises are not allowed to use in this CA2). Train and test machine learning models
for the user-user or item-item collaborative filtering. Justify your recommendations for the considered
scenario by providing a conceptual insight.
2) Perform Market Basket Analysis on the chosen dataset by using Apriori and FP growth algorithms. Can
you express major divergence between these models? Compare and contrast the machine learning results
obtained based on both algorithms.
(50, 50 = 100 marks)
3) Create an interactive Dashboard aimed at older adults (65+) with specific features to summarise the most
important aspects of the data and identify through your visualisation why this dataset is suitable for
Machine Learning models in an online retail business. Explain how your dashboard is designed with this
demographic in mind.
